# Edgar.jl - Lex

Edgar defers all natural language understanding (NLU) to the AWS Lex service.
Lex is a powerful platform for building interactive chatbots and provides
convenient abstractions for managing a human-readable conversation.

## Usage

This folder contains an export of Edgar's current lex chatbot. It is NOT
recomended to modify the json file directly, instead the backup should be
imported to the AWS Lex console, modified, and re-exported.
